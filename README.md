## Overview of Project
* Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.


## Results
* The Results for the anaylysis show how long it takes to run data throught the entire worksheet at a fast pace and the nested for loops are simplified from the original code allowing the spreadsheet to be used in a simplified way. 

## Summary

* In general, the code being refactored helps allow Steve to analyize the data more efficiently, however by using the refactored code it may cause the original code to encounter errors and become dispoal to the entire worksheet. 
* The major advantages of the original and reforactored code that it can be interchangeable to allow for changes to be made throughout the VBA they only thing that would be necessary to change is the module the code is written in.
* The major disadvantage is the refactored code could can produce more errors that could be harder to find than in the original code.
